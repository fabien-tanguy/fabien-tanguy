# Hi, I'm Fabien

### About Me

- **Founder of [Chrono Journey Engine](https://github.com/fabien-tanguy/chrono-journey-engine)**  
  An open-source framework for building interactive timelines that blend history, fiction, and emotion.  
  My work brings together robust data structures and intuitive interfaces, exploring both real and fictional universes (Star Wars, Marvel, Ninjago, etc.).

- **[chrono-journey.com](https://chrono-journey.com) — Demo & Showcase**  
  This website is the public MVP and the main showcase for Chrono Journey Engine.  
  It already features many core functionalities, and my goal is to make the engine available to the community so others can create, extend, and contribute new timelines.

- **SQL & Data Engineering**  
  Currently preparing for the **Oracle Database SQL (1Z0-071)** certification, to strengthen the reliability and scalability of my data solutions.

- **Technical Stack**  
  Typescript, Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS.
